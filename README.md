### Bare bones issue tracker using the MEAN stack

This is a small program created to demonstrate the common capabilities of the MEAN stack.

For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about:

Express ---> http://expressjs.com/

AngularJS > https://angularjs.org/

Node.js --> http://nodejs.org/

2. Open a Terminal in the root directory of the app.

4. Install dependencies

```

5. Run the server
